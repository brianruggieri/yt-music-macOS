## Installation

### Homebrew (Recommended)

```bash
brew tap 0xjemm/youtube-music-macos
brew install --cask youtube-music-macos
xattr -cr /Applications/YouTube\ Music.app
```

### Manual

1. Download the latest release from [Releases](../../releases)
2. Extract and drag to Applications
3. Run `xattr -cr /Applications/YouTube\ Music.app` (required for unnotarized apps)
4. Open and sign in to YouTube Music

### Building from Source

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `Secrets.example.swift` to `youtube-music-player/Secrets.swift` and fill in your IDs (both are optional — see below)
3. Build and run, either way:
   - **Xcode:** open `youtube-music-player.xcodeproj` and press ⌘R
   - **Terminal:** `./run.sh` — copies the example into `Secrets.swift` if missing, builds Release, and launches the app

`run.sh` does a clean build each time, so it always picks up newly added source files.

## Discord Rich Presence Setup

1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Create a new application
3. Copy the Application ID
4. Paste it into `Secrets.swift` as `discordClientId`

## Spotify Import Setup

Importing playlists requires your own Spotify app credentials:

1. Create an app at the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Set the **Redirect URI** to `ytmusic-import://callback`
3. While the app is in Development Mode, add your Spotify account under the app's users (Spotify caps this at 5 users)
4. Copy the **Client ID** and paste it into `Secrets.swift` as `spotifyClientID`
5. Rebuild, then use the in-app **Import from Spotify** flow to connect and import

## Requirements

- macOS 14.0 (Sonoma) or later
- Xcode 16+ (for building)
